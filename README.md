## Hi there, Giuliano De Ioanni here 👋

👨‍💻 About Me: Frontend Engineer with 13+ years of successful software delivery experience. Expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, and frontend architecture. Skilled in developing both web applications and mobile experiences with Expo. Passionate about Design Systems, CI/CD, Micro Frontends, and DX tooling. Built scalable enterprise monorepos with design system integration, standardized deploy and testing workflows.

I've spent the last 8 years creating web UIs, working closely with product and design teams to ship features that don't just work today but can be maintained tomorrow.

🚀 My motto: "Maintainability is a feature."
